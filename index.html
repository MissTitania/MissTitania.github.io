				<p>I'm Titania Emmons, a New York City programmer who studied computer science at Caltech.  My interests and background are in Java coding, machine learning/AI, web development, information theory, and some of the other more theoretical aspects of CS, though I have experience with Python and functional programming as well.  You can browse this site to check out some of my more recent coding projects!</p>
				<p>Some older undertakings don't appear here.  In high school I worked on a bridge bidding AI, a challenging problem thanks to imperfect information, cooperative agents, and ludicrously-high game complexity.  To this day programs are inadequate for top-level competition.  My algorithm relied on drawing random hands consistent with bids thus far for Monte Carlo simulation, recursively iterating (re-generating samples at each step) to foresee potential outcomes from both self and partner perspectives without ever acting as if under perfect information from either side. Outcomes were rated with a double-dummy solver.  The result was powerful enough to consistently defeat random Bridge Base Online opponents!  Another hobby project was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize">Netflix Contest</a>, for which I made attempts myself and followed some of the published papers.  Mostly these methods were based on stochastic gradient descent with feature extraction vectors using k-fold cross-valuation on training data.  Admittedly out-performing Netflix's algorithm was trivial, but as you may infer I did not manage to best teams of PhDs to win the $1,000,000 (*Pout*).</p>
				<p>I have a strong math background and previously in a public high school taught the subject - mostly precalculus.  It was rewarding to structure ideas in ways that make new information intuitive, and served as a great developer of communication skills.</p>
				<p>For fun I play games of all varieties, be it board, strategy, card, video, tabletop, or sports.  To me the essential divide between games and life is that games tell in objective terms how to win, and I find this an invigorating shift.  Many of these I undertake competitively.  Most notable is bridge; I was on the US Bridge Federation international team in 2011 and have previously played for hire.  Currently I also compete in Pokemon tournaments, and in the past I've competed at volleyball, fencing, Magic: the Gathering, and a number of other gaming endeavors.  Not the least of which was being named world champion at numerous games published by the <a href="http://sirlingames.com">Sirlin Games</a> company!</p>

				<p>This is an in-browser AI implementation for the classic game Othello.  If you haven't played before, I recommend you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi">start here</a> with the rules.</p>
				<p>This AI runs a minimax search with alpha-beta pruning heuristics to find the most favorable obtainable position.  There's no transposition table because the collision rate in Othello is too low to be worthwhile.  Mid-game states are evaluated using a function pre-computed through neural networks on such features as differential of legal moves and the perfect-play results of sub-games of different board subsets.</p>
				<p>The neural nets are coded and trained separately in Java to allow for blazing-fast computation with bitboard representations.  The technique stores boards as 2 64-bit integers (1 for each player) marking all piece positions with a 1 bit.  With some cleverness, this allows all relevant features like legal moves, flipped pieces, and board subsets to be calculated in extremely few clock cycles with basic bitwise operations and precomputed masks.</p>

				<p>The server of <a href="https://pokemonshowdown.com">Pokemon Showdown</a> (a community for competitively-minded Pokemon battling as a strategy game) called Azure desperately needed an interface remodeling.  This was for reasons of readability, aesthetics, and ease of use.  They hired me to remake their CSS for this purpose.  The catch?  Esoteric rules in their license agreement with the larger Showdown community allow them only to modify server-side code.  They must use the same client as the rest of Pokemon Showdown, verbatim.  My challenge is to redo the interface without modifying either the underlying JS code or the DOM.  Spicy!  The result contained a great deal of animation, both for a sexier product and intuitive identification of what things on screen were even control elements, so for an authentic experience I encourage you to try injecting <a href="https://github.com/MissTitania/AzureCSSOverhaul">the style sheets</a> yourself and see it all in action!  Still pictures can only tell so much :(</p>
				<p>For starters, PS is a battle-based entity, so let's cut right to the chase with the battle interface:</p>
				<div class="before-after-box">
					<div id="before-1"></div>
					<div class="arrow"></div>
					<div id="after-1"></div>
				</div>
				<p>Moving the team and name display sidebars up top creates a lot more space to show off all the actual battle!  The graphical space in the center is where all the attack, terrain, and weather animations play out, so playing that up easily improves the user experience.  But the biggest gain of all isn't even visible in the picture.  See that little notch at the bottom of the re-designed battlefield?  As moves are made, all of them get called out by trainers in speech bubbles right there.  Beforehand all these actions merely got dumped in a chat log elsewhere.  Because that's what every little kid wants in his Pokemon experience: to scroll back through textual data dumps to see what moves just executed.  This is the 21st century; we should be past that kind of thing.  Next up is private conversations:</p>
				<div class="before-after-box">
					<div id="before-2"></div>
					<div class="arrow"></div>
					<div id="after-2"></div>
				</div>
				<p>As you can see, even short conversations few in number quickly overwhelm the available space for these things.  That main menu on the left doesn't do a whole lot except for when you're queueing up or configuring your team for battle; it just eats up our direct message space.  Given that, it makes sense to have it be retractable.  Then we can have luxurious wide conversations and battle challenges.  And the new DM boxes offer a lot of smart benefits, from twinkling to display when you have notifications to sliding into and out of existence with more intelligent vertical sizing and minimization.</p>
				<div class="before-after-box">
					<div id="before-3"></div>
					<div class="arrow"></div>
					<div id="after-3"></div>
				</div>
				<p>Here's what that main menu looks like when we reach to slide it out.  It centers properly and comes out further than before, both to take advantage of all the extra space we get by having it slide out over top of private conversations.  And perhaps a bit bafflingly... the main menu is finally <i>just one</i> menu.  Instead of three.  Why those features pertaining to the one purpose were broken up is hard to figure.  And of course because it's a server about battling, now the battle-related options are adorned with slick mouseover animations and flashy icons on mouseover.  Can't skimp on the action!</p>
				<div class="before-after-box">
					<div id="before-4"></div>
					<div class="arrow"></div>
					<div id="after-4"></div>
				</div>
				<p>Here's a public chatroom.  All the conversation was punctuated with various polls, server declares, tournament updates, and more, definitely to the point of excess.  With some reformatting and opacity usage, all these things can be made much less intrusive so as not to break up discussion.  As a bonus, now the server mascot Pokemon (as redrawn by me) can be seen without so much junk on top!  You may notice the motif throughout all these shots of darkening the color scheme dramatically and only using bright colors for display of important content.  Not only does it make extended use considerably easier on the eyes, it also naturally guides your gaze to where the real information is located.</p>
				<p>There's quite a lot more in these same motivational veins scattered across every possible interface component, so I do encourage you to check it out by injecting the CSS yourself.  Seeing all the newly-animated components and using it yourself makes for an experience still images cannot tell.  And if you do, don't forget it all happened without ability to change an ounce of Javascript or the DOM!</p>
