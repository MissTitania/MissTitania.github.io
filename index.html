				<p>I'm Titania Emmons, a New York City programmer who studied computer science at Caltech.  My interests and background are in Java coding, machine learning/AI, web development, information theory, and some of the other more theoretical aspects of CS, though I have experience with Python and functional programming as well.  You can browse this site to check out some of my more recent coding projects!</p>
				<p>Some older undertakings don't appear here.  In high school I worked on a bridge bidding AI, a challenging problem thanks to imperfect information, cooperative agents, and ludicrously-high game complexity.  To this day programs are inadequate for top-level competition.  My algorithm relied on drawing random hands consistent with bids thus far for Monte Carlo simulation, recursively iterating (re-generating samples at each step) to foresee potential outcomes from both self and partner perspectives without ever acting as if under perfect information from either side. Outcomes were rated with a double-dummy solver.  The result was powerful enough to consistently defeat random Bridge Base Online opponents!  Another hobby project was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize">Netflix Contest</a>, for which I made attempts myself and followed some of the published papers.  Mostly these methods were based on stochastic gradient descent with feature extraction vectors using k-fold cross-valuation on training data.  Admittedly out-performing Netflix's own rating prediction algorithm was trivial, but as you may infer I did not manage to best teams of PhDs to win the $1,000,000 (*Pout*).</p>
				<p>I have a strong math background and previously in a public high school taught the subject - mostly precalculus.  It was rewarding to structure ideas in ways that make new information intuitive, and served as a great developer of communication skills.</p>
				<p>For fun I play games of all varieties, be it board, strategy, card, video, tabletop, or sports.  To me the essential divide between games and life is that games tell in objective terms how to win, and I find this an invigorating shift.  Many of these I undertake competitively.  Most notable is bridge; I was on the US Bridge Federation international team in 2011 and have previously played for hire.  Currently I also compete in Pokemon tournaments, and in the past I've competed at volleyball, fencing, Magic: the Gathering, been named the world champion at numerous board games published by the <a href="http://sirlingames.com">Sirlin Games</a> company, and a number of other competitive gaming endeavors.</p>

				<p>This is an in-browser AI implementation for the classic game Othello.  If you haven't played before, I recommend you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi">start here</a> with the rules.</p>
				<p>This AI runs a minimax search with alpha-beta pruning heuristics to find the most favorable obtainable position.  There's no transposition table because the collision rate in Othello is too low to be worthwhile.  Mid-game states are evaluated using a function pre-computed through neural networks on such features as differential of legal moves and the perfect-play results of sub-games of different board subsets.</p>
				<p>The neural nets are coded and trained separately in Java to allow for blazing-fast computation with bitboard representations.  The technique stores boards as 2 64-bit integers (1 for each player) marking all piece positions with a 1 bit.  With some cleverness, this allows all relevant features like legal moves, flipped pieces, and board subsets to be calculated in extremely few clock cycles with basic bitwise operations and precomputed masks.</p>

				<p>The server of <a href="https://pokemonshowdown.com">Pokemon Showdown</a> (a community for competitively-minded Pokemon battling as a strategy game) called Azure desperately needed an interface remodeling.  This was for reasons of readability, aesthetics, and ease of use.  They enlisted my help to remake their CSS for this purpose.  The catch?  Esoteric rules in their license agreement with the larger Showdown community allow them only to modify server-side code.  They must use the same client as the rest of Pokemon Showdown, verbatim.  My challenge is to redo the interface without modifying either the underlying JS code or the DOM.  Spicy!</p>
