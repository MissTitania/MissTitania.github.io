				<p>
				Hey, I'm Titania. My main interests are data analysis, web development, and information theory. I have the most experience coding in Python and Java. You can browse this site to check out a couple of my coding projects!
				</p>
				<p>
				I love Bridge since high school. I actually played on the USA's international team in 2011. I also worked on bridge bidding AI. This is a hard problem because of imperfect information and a very large game tree. My algorithm used recursive Monte Carlo simulation. A double-dummy solver rated outcomes. To this day programs are inadequate for top-level competition. The result was powerful enough to defeat random Bridge Base Online opponents!
				</p>
				<p>
				I also competed in the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize">Netflix Contest</a>. I used stochastic gradient descent with feature extraction and k-fold cross-validation. I outperformed Netflix's old algorithm but did not win the contest.
				</p>
				<p>
				I have a strong math background. I taught high school, including at Thomas Jefferson. For fun, I play games of all varieties, be it board, strategy, card, video, tabletop, or sports. Among others, I have competed in volleyball, fencing, Magic the gathering.

				<p>This is an in-browser AI implementation for the classic game Othello.  If you haven't played before, I recommend you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi">start here</a> with the rules.</p>
				<p>
					Neural nets were implemented and trained in java. This AI runs a minimax search with alpha-beta pruning heuristics. There's no transposition table.  The collision rate in Othello is too low to be worthwhile. A pre-computed function evaluates mid-game board states. The differential of legal moves is one feature. Another feature is the perfect-play results of sub-games of different board subsets.
				</p>
				<p>
					The technique stores boards as 2 64-bit integers (1 for each player) marking all piece positions with a 1 bit. This allows very fast computations with bitboard manipulations and pre-computed masks.

				<p>The server of <a href="https://pokemonshowdown.com">Pokemon Showdown</a> (a community for competitively-minded Pokemon battling as a strategy game) called Azure desperately needed an interface remodeling.  This was for reasons of readability, aesthetics, and ease of use.  They hired me to remake their CSS for this purpose, but the catch was that esoteric rules in their license agreement with the larger Showdown community allow them only to modify server-side code.  They must use the same client as the rest of Pokemon Showdown verbatim, differing only by a style sheet modification.  So my task was to update to a more modern interface without modifying either the underlying JS code or the DOM.  The result contained a great deal of animation, both for a sleeker-looking product and intuitive identification of what things on screen were even control elements.  This means that for an authentic experience I would encourage you to try injecting <a href="https://github.com/MissTitania/AzureCSSOverhaul">the style sheets</a> yourself and see it all in action!  Still pictures can only tell so much sadly</p>
				<p>For starters, PS is a battle-based entity, so let's cut right to the chase with the battle interface:</p>
				<div class="before-after-box">
					<div id="before-1"></div>
					<div class="arrow"></div>
					<div id="after-1"></div>
				</div>
				<p>Moving the team and name display sidebars up top creates a lot more space to show off all the actual battle!  The graphical space in the center is where all the attack, terrain, and weather animations play out, so playing that up easily improves the user experience.  But the biggest gain of all isn't even visible in the picture.  See that little notch at the bottom of the re-designed battlefield?  As moves are made, all of them get called out by trainers in speech bubbles right there.  Beforehand all these actions merely got dumped in a chat log elsewhere.  Surely one of the best ways to ruin a child's fun Pokemon experience is forcing them to scroll back through textual data dumps to see what's happening, so the change was very much overdo.  Next up is private conversations:</p>
				<div class="before-after-box">
					<div id="before-2"></div>
					<div class="arrow"></div>
					<div id="after-2"></div>
				</div>
				<p>As you can see, even short conversations few in number quickly overwhelm the space allocated for them.  That main menu on the left doesn't do a whole lot except for when you're queueing up or configuring your team for battle; it just eats up direct message space.  Given that, it makes sense to have it be retractable.  Then we can have luxurious wide conversations and battle challenges.  And the new direct message boxes offer a lot of smart benefits, from subtley brightening to display when you have notifications to more intelligent vertical sizing rules and minimization to allow as many of these conversations at once as is feasible.</p>
				<div class="before-after-box">
					<div id="before-3"></div>
					<div class="arrow"></div>
					<div id="after-3"></div>
				</div>
				<p>Here's what that main menu looks like when we slide it out. It centers properly. We created extra space by sliding over inactive conversations. Now the menu can come out further than before. The menu is now one menu instead of three. Battle options are now adorned with animations. The activity and hype should align with the intended purpose!</p>
				<div class="before-after-box">
					<div id="before-4"></div>
					<div class="arrow"></div>
					<div id="after-4"></div>
				</div>
				<p>
					Here's a public chatroom. Conversations were punctuated with various polls, server declarations, tournament updates, and more. We can make these less obtrusive with reformatting and better use of opacity. As a bonus, now we can see the server mascot. We darkened the color scheme and only used bright colors for important content.
				</p>
				<p>
					Remember all changes had to be achieved through CSS.
